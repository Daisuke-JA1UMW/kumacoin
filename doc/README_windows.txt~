Intro
-----
KumaCoin is a free open source project derived from NovaCoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.

Setup
-----
After completing windows setup then run windows command line (cmd)
  cd daemon
  kumacoind
You would need to create a configuration file kumacoin.conf in the default
wallet directory. Grant access to kumacoind.exe in anti-virus and firewall
applications if necessary.

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 12788 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  KumaCoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the KumaCoin network.

Upgrade
-------
All you existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade first backup wallet
kumacoind backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown kumacoind by
kumacoind stop
Start up the new kumacoind.
